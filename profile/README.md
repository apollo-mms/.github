## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are a **branch** of @apollotwenty. We are the main branch as we are where H and his team go to. Our goal is to bring back Student Internet Rights.


## Projects 


**Hades** is a database full of links to proxies and game sites that are unblocked. This was made due to a yearly **reset** in SUSD where we lose our links.

**Atomic** is a USB that has some of **Hades** links in it.

**Eris** is a private games site

**Poesiden** is a public games site.

**Hermes** is a links market place.
